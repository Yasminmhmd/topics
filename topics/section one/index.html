    <h1>my story</h1>
   <p>In a quiet village, an old clock tower stood silent, forgotten by time. One night, a curious girl named Elara wandered near it, drawn by its mystery.<br>
     As she touched the ancient wood, the clock chimed,<mark> awakening the spirits of lost dreams</mark>.
     <strong> Whispers filled the air</strong>,<small> weaving stories of love and longing</small>. 
     <b>Elara listened,</b> captivated, as they shared tales of hope,<em> reminding her of her own unrealized dreams</em>
     <sub>. With newfound courage, she vowed to chase them.</sub>
      The next morning, the clock began to tick again, and the village felt alive with possibility.<pre><sup>
         Elara painted her dreams across the sky,</sup> inspiring others to do the same.
         <mark> The clock tower became a symbol of rebirth,</mark> reminding everyone to embrace their dreams. 
         And from that day on, time never felt so precious.</pre>
